# Document-Summarization-by-key-sentence-extraction-using-NN
Codes and reports of the Foundations Machine Learning (IIT Bombay) course project. In this work we perform document summarization by extracting key sentences from a document using neural networks. We explored simple NN, CNNs and ensemble of NN/CNN and observed that a CNN based model performed better.
